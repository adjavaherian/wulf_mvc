# [Wulf MVC](https://github.com/adjavaherian/wulf_mvc)

Wulf MVC on HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or ReSTFul sites using a jQuery based MVC Design Pattern.

This project stems from a pattern which was originally published by Adam Wulf at
http://welcome.totheinter.net/tutorials/model-view-controller-in-jquery/.

Like HTML5 Boilerplate, it does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want and use
the code as a template for developing robust application with class-like MVC objects.
